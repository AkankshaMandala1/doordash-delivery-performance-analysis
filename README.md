# DoorDash Delivery Performance Analysis (Python • SQL/DuckDB • Tableau)

## Overview

## Key Questions
- Which markets have the worst late delivery rates?
- Which restaurant categories / stores are highest risk?
- Does dasher congestion correlate with delivery duration?
- What are peak-hour patterns?
- Does order complexity increase delivery time?

## Tableau Dashboard
- Tableau Public: [https://public.tableau.com/shared/YHR6CQ7PX?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link](https://public.tableau.com/shared/YHR6CQ7PX?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
